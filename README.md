# Books-upon-books
Need a way  to look up your favorite books, this is the place for you!

## Description

This book-search app uses google's book API to look up any book you could think of.Think of it as 'My Anime List' (MAL), but for books. 
Just like MAL, you can look up a book, and add it to your personalized list of books. Once saved, you have the option of deleting the books on your list, hence you have flexibility guaranteed as you curate your list. 

Here is a link to the site: [Books upon books]().

## Examples of basic functionality

## Future developments

In the future, I'm hoping to add more customization propertities, like the ability to create different lists, eg "Finished books", "Books I'm planning to read", and "Books I'm currently reading".
